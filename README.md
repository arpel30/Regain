# Regain - Spyware app.
The main goal is to capture all the data from the user's notifications like email, sms, Whatsapp, Instagram and more.

### Why would the user give us the required permission ?
Because the spyware is displayed as an application that captures messages removed from Whatsapp.

## The app has a main screen where you can see all of the users you talked with on Whatsapp sorted by time & date :

## When you choose one of the users you will see all of the messages he sent you, including deleted messages :

## When a message is deleted you will receive a notification :

But in the app you will see the original message : <br><br>

## Behind the curtain there is a database that collects all of the information from all of your app's notifications.
